# CMS Cards

## Building

Run `gulp` from the command line to build the cards

## Running / Testing

You can run the card renders against mocked content (as if from the delivery API) by spinning up a python server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and visiting `localhost:8000`.

If you prefer another server, you may need to change the ports of `templateUrl`'s in `/index.html`
